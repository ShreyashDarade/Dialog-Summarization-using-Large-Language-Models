# Dialog-Summarization-using-Large-Language-Models

This repository contains notebook files that discuss Large Language Models (LLMs), covering topics like fine-tuning, prompt engineering, and techniques such as PEFT (Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning) and PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization) etc.

### 1. Summarize_dialogue_LLM.ipynb:

Explore dialogue summarization with generative AI and discover how input text influences model output.
Learn prompt engineering techniques to tailor the model's output for specific tasks.
Compare zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot inferences to enhance Large Language Models' generative capabilities.

### 2. Fine_tune_LLM.ipynb:

Dive into the fine-tuning process for improving dialogue summarization using the FLAN-T5 model.
Utilize FLAN-T5, a high-quality instruction-tuned model, to summarize text effectively.

### 3. Fine_tune_model_to_detoxify_summaries.ipynb:

Understand how to fine-tune a FLAN-T5 model to generate less toxic content using Meta AI's hate speech reward model.
Experiment with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to reduce the model's toxicity and create safer summaries.
